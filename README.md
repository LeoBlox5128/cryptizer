<br>⚙️ Highly customizable
<br>⚡ Very fast but also very lightweight

## 🪄 Features
- 💵 Check current price of almost any cryptocurrency
- 💹 Analytics and predictions [SOON]

- 🤯 15MB RAM usage, less than 1% CPU usage on most 2015+ devices

## 🔧 Installation
Linux/Windows only. Mac not tested, but it should work.
<br>If you're using Windows, make sure it's Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 or 11. XP or older not supported.

You can go to the [releases](https://github.com/LeoBlox5128/cryptizer/releases/), and continue there. I have instructions for every supported OS.

## 📖 Documentation
After running the file, you should see something like this:

	Enter full cryptocurrency token name > 

Type in the cryptocurrency name. Some examples are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin.

**Do not type the symbol (BTC, ETH, DOGE).
<br>Currently, there is no support for symbols, but I'm already working on it.**

If you've already typed the cryptocurrency name, in this example Bitcoin, you should see this:

	1 Bitcoin --> 19502.01$

Good job! You have acquired the current price of Bitcoin!
<br>Note that you may get other results. I'm certainly sure it won't be 19502.01$ when you check it.
